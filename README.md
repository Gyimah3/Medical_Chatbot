# Medical_Chatbot

Healthcare chatbots are the next frontier in virtual customer service as well as planning and management in healthcare businesses. From helping a patient manage a chronic condition better to helping patients who are visually or hearing impaired access critical information, chatbots are a revolutionary way of assisting patients efficiently and effectively. They can also be used to determine whether a certain situation is an emergency or not. This allows the patient to be taken care of fast and can be helpful during future doctor’s or nurse’s appointments.
